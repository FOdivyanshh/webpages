    <h3>Dr. OCTOPUS</h3>
    <p>Otto Octavius had a turbulent upbringing. His father, a factory worker, was abusive and violent towards both Otto and his mother, leading Otto to be shy and reclusive in school.
       However, at his mother's insistence, he was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. 
       It was hinted that he was a low-level telepathic mutant whose powers emerged at puberty; this mutation may have been responsible for giving his father an aneurysm as his father went to beat him.
        His father's death in an industrial accident pushed Otto further towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science.</p>
